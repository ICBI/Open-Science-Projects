## About Georgetown-ICBI
The [Innovation Center for Biomedical Informatics (ICBI)](https://icbi.georgetown.edu) at [Georgetown University](https://lombardi.georgetown.edu/Biomedical-Informatics.html) was launched in 2012 as an academic hub for innovative research in the field of data science and biomedical informatics, with the goal of enabling individualized approaches to healthcare through data science and informatics approaches. ICBI’s mission is to enhance clinical and translational research at Georgetown University Medical Center as well as its partners and, in turn, attract and educate the next generation of scientists and physicians for whom biomedical informatics and health data science will be an integral part of both biomedical research and clinical practice. 

## Software Development
The research information technology group at ICBI develops innovative scientific software to enable translational research. Our projects include muti-omics data analysis, vaccine safety research, clinical data analysis, high definition data visualization, natural language processing, and mobile application development. 

As of 2013, we have a total of 78 github repositories (private and public)

## Our collaborators in Open Science
ICBI is an academic hub for Data Science with the primary mission of conducting investigator initiated research in data science & Informatics, education and training. We use a variety of clinical and research data types, methods, tools, and resources and work with multiple Principal Investigators (PIs). We highlight some of our collaborators below:

* [The Griffith Lab](https://github.com/griffithlab) has developed [CIViC](https://civicdb.org/home) for crowdsourcing of gene/variant evidence curation and is working with us on the [Clingen](https://www.clinicalgenome.org/) project on somatic mutations 
* [Héctor Corrada Bravo](http://github.com/hcorrada) is Associate Professor, at the Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at Univ. of Maryland. Our team led by [@SiminaB](https://github.com/SiminaB) collaborates with his lab on the CDGnet project. 
* [Cathy Wu](https://bioinformatics.udel.edu/people/personnel/cathy_wu/) is Professor and Director, Center for Bioinformatics & Computational Biology (CBCB) at University of Delaware. Our team led by [@pmcgarvey](https://github.com/orgs/ICBI/people/pmcgarvey) collaborates with Cathy's team on the MACE2K project including the eGARD natural language processing (NLP) tool.
